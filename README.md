# Scrapping tool for polish car detailing shops to compare prices between them

Covid project that was created to help me finding the best offerts for products on polish car detailing shops. Project was functional and was meeting the basic assumptions, but was lacking of few important features (like caching data and history of prices) that due to lack of time was never finished, and probably never will. Also after some time a lot of shops change their layouts, so app just stopped working properly 

# Features
* Finding given products on few detailing shops
* Ability to search few products at one time
* Multi threaded searching
* Getting basic and discout prices 
* Comparing products prices in 3 categories: The chepes product of all shops, the chepest offerts from every shop, and the chepeast offerts inside every shop
* Ability to add another shop to compare in quick way
* Almost free cheking for anti bot protection on websites (at least one of shop implement anti-bot protection while i was testing this app v:)

# Things to do
* Finish price history and caching data system
* Add protection for endlessly loading sites
* Make a searcher engine a little bit less aggresive
* Reweirte all data that referes to elements to scrap on websites
* Add ability to add promo codes for every shops to calculate final price
* Add cart-like system - ability to save products from searches in one place
